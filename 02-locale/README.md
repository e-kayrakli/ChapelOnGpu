This example demonstrates `locale`s as a more first-class citizen in the
language. Just like `int` or `string`, `locale` is a built-in type in the
language. You can have `locale` variables or store them in arrays and other data
structures.

Furthermore, this example also introduces a very powerful (but orthogonal to GPU
programming) concept that is unique to Chapel: `config` variables.
